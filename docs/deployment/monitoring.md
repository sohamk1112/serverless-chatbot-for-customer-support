2. Configure notifications for alarms (e.g., via SNS).

## Step 2: Create CloudWatch Dashboards
1. Set up dashboards to monitor the health and performance of your system.
2. Include key metrics such as Lambda invocation counts, error rates, and API Gateway response times.

## Step 3: Regular Monitoring
1. Regularly check the dashboards and alarms.
2. Investigate and resolve any issues promptly.
