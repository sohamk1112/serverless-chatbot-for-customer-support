# Scalability Testing

## Step 1: Simulate High Traffic
1. Use a load testing tool (e.g., Apache JMeter, Gatling) to simulate high traffic.
2. Configure the tool to send a large number of requests to the API Gateway endpoint.

## Step 2: Monitor Performance
1. Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance of your Lambda functions and API Gateway.
2. Check for any bottlenecks or performance issues.

## Step 3: Optimize and Scale
1. Identify any performance issues from the monitoring data.
2. Optimize your Lambda code and API Gateway configuration if necessary.
3. Consider enabling auto-scaling for Lambda functions if needed.
